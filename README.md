  Three Part Kickstarter Analysis

Overview of Project.

The purpose of this analysis was to forecast for Louise the probability that her funded play will in all likely hood succeed based on the data of previous theater plays.  The outcome, time of year, and genre were key analysis points in the overall data.

Analysis and Challenges:

I performed my analysis by following the directions step by step performing functions and commands such as year(), countifs(), sums(), and creating visual charts from pivot table data extracted from the master data sheet Kickstarter. I had difficulties in keeping all of the sheets in order and straight in in my mind while working to organize the data on screen.  

Results:

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?  The most successful theater outcomes were in the summer months. The rate of successful plays to failed was about 2 to 1 and canceled plays were negligible. 

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?  There was a true overlap of results three times in the line plotted visual data; once at 15,000-19,999, once at 35,000, and once at 40,000 to 45,000. 
What are some limitations of this dataset? Some of the limitations of the data set was that the dataset was too eclectic without any true uniformed or unifying variables. 
What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?  Some possible tables or graphs would a be line graph or pivot  table with all the data points included but this was impossible because there was too much variance in the data overall when highlighted.  This was by design to test out column making abilities. I would also include a histogram because the time of year is important to see when the most successful plays are put on which is the summer and the occasional cancelation in winter with the
